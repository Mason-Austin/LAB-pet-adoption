# Pet Adoption  [![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/ffe68816-9d2f-4c67-8f3f-2d7187fb13de/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/masons-pet-adoption/deploys)

This project just allows the user to have a list of pets and what makes them unique. It also allows them to add or delete pets from the website.

## About the User <!-- This is a scaled down user persona -->
- The form which add pets does not pop up unitl you click "Add pet"
- The ideal user for this application is a animal adoption center
- They have pets that they want to find forever homes for
- The problem this app solves for them is it allows them to display all the pets they have, and something unique about them. It also allows them to add new pets or delete adopted pets.

## Features <!-- List your app features using bullets! Do NOT use a paragraph. No one will read that! -->
- When a new pet is added an object should be created and that object should be pushed into an array of pets that then prints to the DOM.
- Pet Type: The color of the pet's card changes depending on which type of bet they are.
