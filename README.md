# Pet Adoption Website
This project we made a website that dynamically renders to the dom. You are able to create new pets and delete existing pets. You can also filter between the different species of pets.

As a developer this project focuses on the concept of dynamically rendering codes to the dom, and being able to manipulate them.
The user for this website would be for a buiness that help pets find permanent homes. This allows them to have a website that showcases each pet and whats special about each one. The website also allows the user to create or delete pets incase they get a new pet, or one gets adopted.
