Here I am putting an overview of what my project is about. It comes below the name of my project so that others can read what it is about and get more details.

[View App](https://masons-pet-adoption.netlify.app/)

## About the User <!-- This is a scaled down user persona -->
- The ideal user for this application is a animal adoption center
- They have pets that they want to find forever homes for
- The problem this app solves for them is it allows them to display all the pets they have, and something unique about them. It also allows them to add new pets or delete adopted pets.

## Features <!-- List your app features using bullets! Do NOT use a paragraph. No one will read that! -->
- When a new pet is added an object should be created and that object should be pushed into an array of pets that then prints to the DOM.
- Pet Type: The color of the pet's card changes depending on which type of bet they are.
